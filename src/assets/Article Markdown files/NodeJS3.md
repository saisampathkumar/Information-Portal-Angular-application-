**_Routing_** refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:

`app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`

Where:

- `app` is an instance of express.
- `METHOD` is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
- `PATH` is a path on the server.
- `HANDLER` is the function executed when the route is matched.

This tutorial assumes that an instance of express named app is created and the server is running. If you are not familiar with creating an app and starting it, see the [Hello world example](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html).

The following examples illustrate defining simple routes.

Respond with `Hello World!` on the homepage:

```typescript
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

Respond to POST request on the root route (/), the applicationâ€™s home page:

```typescript
app.post("/", function(req, res) {
  res.send("Got a POST request");
});
```

Respond to a PUT request to the /user route:

```typescript
app.put("/user", function(req, res) {
  res.send("Got a PUT request at /user");
});
```

Respond to a DELETE request to the /user route:

```typescript
app.delete("/user", function(req, res) {
  res.send("Got a DELETE request at /user");
});
```
